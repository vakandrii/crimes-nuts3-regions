# Crimes by NUTS 3 regions

> This project is developed in a **group of 3 people**.

The aim of the project is to analyze data provided by Eurostat. This concerns the following dataset:

- **ID**: `crim_gen_reg`
- **Title**: Police-recorded offences by NUTS 3 regions
- **URL**: [Eurostat - Police-recorded offences by NUTS 3 regions](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/crim_gen_reg/default/table?lang=en&category=crim.crim_off)

We are interested in data from Spain, which:

- Represents data on the number of criminal offenses in regions of the country according to the NUTS 3 administrative division.
- Relates to various categories of criminal offenses.
- Is linked to the year 2021.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project (You are reading it right now!).
- `crimes_nuts3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for performing basic statistical inquiries and visualizations,
constructing a contingency table of criminal offenses by categories and formulating and conducting hypothesis tests based 
on the dataset characteristics.
